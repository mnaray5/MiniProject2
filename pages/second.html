        West Side, west of the Chicago River and adjacent to the Loop. The Great Chicago
        Fire of 1871 started on the Near West Side. Waves of immigration shaped the history
        of the Near West Side of Chicago, including the founding of Hull House, a prominent
        settlement house.[3] In the 19th century railroads became prominent features. In the mid-20th 
        century, the area saw the development of freeways centered in the Jane Byrne Interchange.</p>
